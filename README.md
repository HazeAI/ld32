Phaser template project

SETUP

npm install
bower install
gulp

Should give you a dev server

With time difference we may need to work for a while with no input from others
Add things you'd like to see magically get done while you're sleeping here
TODOS:
- Enemy classes
- Bullet collision
- Slot machine functionality for mixing and matching weapon bits, arrays of available weapon classes, available graphics, and 3rd property (scale?, projectile speed?, projectile rate of fire? One of these properties at random? All are externally setable on all weapon classes)
- Something to define levels - bg layers and enemy distribution
